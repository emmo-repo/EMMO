EMMO results from a multidisciplinary effort to develop a standard representational framework  that is consistent with scientific principles and methodologies.
It is based on physics, analytical philosophy and information and communication technologies.
EMMO provides a framework for knowledge capture and interoperability in applied science and engineering, especially materials science and manufacturing.
It is released under a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 license.

## EMMO structure
This repository contains the EMMO top- and middle level ontologies, constituting the core of EMMO.
The EMMO top-level ontology is consists of the fundamental mereocausality level and the perspective level, which supports a pluralistic representation of the world.

The EMMO middle-level ontology consists of the reference level, which includes the full standard model of physics and the representation of data and information, and the discipline level, providing a common foundation for different disciplines including metrology, materials and manufacturing.
Each level is implemented in a set of interdependent modules as illustrated in the figure below.
A more detailed figure including all the modules can be found [here](doc/figs/EMMO-structure.png).

## Repository Description
The different levels and versions of EMMO can be imported according to the following table:

| Name           | Link                            | Comment                                                                         |
|----------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| emmo           | https://w3id.org/emmo           | Loads all EMMO modules, excluding the full standard model and specialised units |
| emmo-tol       | https://w3id.org/emmo/tlo       | EMMO top level                                                                  |
| emmo-reference | https://w3id.org/emmo/reference | EMMO reference level                                                            |
| emmo-mlo       | https://w3id.org/emmo/mlo       | EMMO middle level                                                               |
| emmo-full      | https://w3id.org/emmo/emmo-full | Loads all EMMO modules, including the full standard model and specialised units |


Also, the following versions of EMMO are provided for ease of use:

| Name            | Link                                  | Comment                                                                                          |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| emmo-for-humans | https://w3id.org/emmo/emmo-for-humans | Version of EMMO middle with IRIs replaced with human readable names. Only intended for examples. |
| emmo-lite       | https://w3id.org/emmo/emmo-lite       | Selected leaf classes and properties for rapid development and deployment in graph databases.    |
| emmo-inferred   | https://w3id.org/emmo/inferred        | Pre-inferred version of EMMO middle level                                                        |

Also, individual levels and modules be imported from the GitHub repository using their IRI.
Use for example https://w3id.org/emmo/perspectives to import the Perspectives level and https://w3id.org/emmo/perspectives/semiotics to import the Semiotics module.
A specific version can be imported by adding the version number after the initial https://w3id.org/emmo/.
For example, https://w3id.org/emmo/1.0.0/perspectives will import Perspectives from version 1.0.0.

> [!NOTE]
> Importing directly from the GitHub repository requires a client that understands `owl:imports`.
> It is also much slower than importing from the links in the above table.

## EMMO expressivity and reasoning
EMMO 1.0.0 Reference Level is compliant with OWL2 DL and supports HermiT and FaCT++ reasoners.
The axioms have been optimised to reduce reasoning time, facilitating usage and development.
Developers of EMMO based ontologies are encouraged to use a reasoner to ensure consistency with the overall framework.
However, all relevant inferred axioms have been already included in the ontology, so that the EMMO 1.0.0 can also be used as-is with reasoning based on less expressive rules than OWL2 DL, or without reasoning at all, according to users' needs.


## Domain Ontologies
Based on the EMMO core, a set of domain-level ontologies have developed by the community.
They either import one of the versions of EMMO listed on [https://emmo-repo.github.io/](https://emmo-repo.github.io/) or selected module from EMMO core.
The following table lists the public EMMO-based domain ontologies that we are aware of.
Please create an issue if you have a public domain ontology that you think should be listed here.

## Application Ontologies

EMMO application ontologies are engineered for a specific use or application by reusing and extending concepts from one or more domain ontologies.
Even though that the delineation between "domain" and "application" ontologies are somewhat arbitrary, a main difference is that the application ontologies are generally not developed for reuse by other domain or application ontologies, while such reuse is the main focus of domain ontologies.
