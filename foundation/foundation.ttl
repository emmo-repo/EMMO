    dcterms:abstract """The EMMO foundation level ontology Introduces the fundamental mereocausal (and mereotopological) concepts of EMMO and their relations with the real world entities that they represent. EMMO uses mereocausality as the ground for all the subsequent ontology modules.

The concept of causal connection is used to distinguish between ontology entities: items are causally self-connected objects, while collections are causally disconnected.
Quantum mereology is based on the concept of quantum entity.
This module introduces also the fundamental mereotopological relations used to distinguish between space and time dimensions, making spacetime emerge from underlying network of causal relations between quantum entities.
