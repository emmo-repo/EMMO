EMMO can in principle represents the Universe with direct parthood relations as a direct rooted tree up to its elementary constituents.

In addition to direct parthood, the reductionistic module defines 'State' as a tesselation of spatial direct parts with no change of granularity or cardinality and 'Existent' as a tesselation of temporal direct parts."""@en ;
