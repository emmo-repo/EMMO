This class is expected to host the definition of world objects as they appear in its relation with the surrounding whole (being a part implies being surrounded by something bigger to which it contributes).
For example. a human being is a stand alone type, but an instance of a human being can also be an instance of the type student (intended as a role) if it plays a part into a school environment (i.e., a student entity can exist only if it is part of a surrounding whole: the school).
The role type requires that also the whole type depends on the existence of parts of a specific type (e.g., there is no school without students)."""@en ;
