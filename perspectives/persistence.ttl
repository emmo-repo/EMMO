More generally. a temporal part is no more of type ϕ when the temporal interval is lower than the interval that characterizes the causality interactions between the object parts.
In other terms, if the time span of a temporal part is lower than the inverse of the frequency of interactions between the constituents, then the constituents in such temporal part are not connected. The object is no more an object, neither an item, but simply a collection of fundamental quantum parts.
For this reason, the definition of object is done by considering only item temporal parts, meaning that slicing in time has the lower limit of a self-connected (i.e. item) entity."""@en .

This perspective provides classes aimed to represent concepts similar to the ones of endurant and perdurant (a.k.a. continuant and occurrent). However, in the EMMO case, an entity is defined as an object or a process according to a specific type, and not per-se. For this reason an entity in the EMMO can be classified both object or a process depending on the reference type, due to the underlying 4D framework (e.g. an individual may belong both to the class of runners and the class of running process), and the distinction is purely representational.
This categorisation has been introduced due to the large use of object/process commonsensical concepts, and the fact that our language distinguish between nouns and verbs to address things, forcing the separation between things that happens and things that persist."""@en .
