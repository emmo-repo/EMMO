EMMO organises the units in the following set of modules:

* Modules for categorising units:
  - sidimensionalunits: A module with classes categorising units according to their SI physical dimensions.

* Modules with SI units:
  - siunits: The 7 base units and 22 derived units as well as the metric prefixes specified in the SI system.
  - prefixedsiunits: SI units made of a metric prefix and a SI base or derived unit. Examples: km, mg...
  - coherentsiunits: Coherent SI-units. Products of integer powers of the base and derived SI units. Examples: A/J, Nm, mÂ³, ...
  - noncoherentsiunits: Non-coherent SI-units whos numerical factor in front of the product of base SI units is NOT equal to one. This include all SI-units not included in the modules above. Examples: g, mg/s...

* Modules with non-SI units:
  - siacceptedspecialunits: The 15 non-SI special units that are accepted for use with SI.
  - siacceptedunits: Non-SI and non-special units that are accepted for use with SI.  These units consists an optional metric prefix followed by a product of integer powers of the base, derived and accepted SI units.  The product must include at least one SI-accepted unit. Examples: km/h, kWh, MeV, etc...
  - specialunits: Special units not accepted for use with the SI system. Examples: Day, Week, Bar, Inch, ...
  - otherunits: All other non-SI units that does not belong to any of the modules above.

* Additional modules:
  - unclassifiedunits: Units copied from QUDT that has not yet been classified in one of the above modules.
  - deprecated: Units classes that have been deprecated - typically because of change of IRI.
