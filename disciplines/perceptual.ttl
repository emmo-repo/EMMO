If the waveform is travelling through a cable as electronic signal (analog or digital) it is no more a sound, since it cannot be perceived by an observer as an acoustical object. This electrical waveform (or digital packet) is another physical that may stand for a sound if interpreted by a device (e.g. an amplifier, a DA converter)."""@en ;

I see a cloud in the sky.

This semiotic process occurs at meta-level: it's how I use the EMMO as tool for a direct representation of the world, understandable by others ontologists.

The semiotic process within EMMO:
My friend looks at the same cloud and says: \"It is an elephant\".
I use the EMMO to record this experience by declaring:
    - my friend as MyFriend individual, belonging to 'Interpreter' classes
    - the sound of the word \"elephant\" as an acoustical perception individual named ElephantWord, belonging to 'Perceptual'
    - a relation hasSign between Cloud and ElephantWord, that makes ElephantWord also belonging to 'Sign' class and Cloud belonging also to 'Object' class
    - a 'Semiosis' individual called MyFriendElephantCloud that hasParticipant: Cloud, ElephantWord and MyFriend, respectively as object, sign and interpreter.

So, the Perceptual class is here to categorized real-world objects at meta-level using common perceptual channels, for practical ontology usage.

We could have represented the word \"elephant\" within a physicalistic approach, by identifying it as a pressure wave in the air."""@en ;

This perspective is based on human characterization of perceptions.
A 'Perceptual' can stand for another object in an EMMO described semiotic process (acting as sign or as object), just like a word on a paper (the perceptual object) may refer semiotically to another object. However, a perceptual is not necessarily a 'Sign' (e.g. a line sketched on a blackboard is a recognizable 'Perceptual' but it may stand for nothing).
A 'Perceptual' becomes a semiotic object, when it is part of a 'Semiotic' process described by the ontologist within the EMMO, and it's done always specifying for which interpreter this relation occurs."""@en .
