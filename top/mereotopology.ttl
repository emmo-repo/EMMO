EMMO uses mereotopology as the ground for all the subsequent ontology modules.  The concept of topological connection is used to define the first distinction between ontology entities namely the 'Item' and 'Collection' classes.  Items are causally self-connected objects, while collections are causally disconnected.  Quantum mereology is represented by the 'Quantum' class. This module introduces also the fundamental mereotopological relations used to distinguish between space and time dimensions."@en ;
