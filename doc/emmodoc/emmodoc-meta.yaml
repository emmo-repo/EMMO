abstract: |
  EMMO is an ontology that is created by the
  <a href="https://emmc.info/">European Materials Modelling Council
  (EMMC)</a> to provide a formal way to describe the fundamental
  concepts of physics, chemistry and materials science. EMMO is
  designed to pave the road for semantic interoperability providing a
  generic common ground for describing materials, models and data that
  can be adapted by all domains.

  It is a representational framework of predefined classes and axioms
  (ontology) provided by experts (EMMC) that enables end users
  (industry, research, academy) to represent real life physical
  entities (materials, devices), models and properties using
  ontological signs (individuals) in a standard way to facilitate
  interactions and exchanges (data, software, knowledge) between all
  involved material modelling and characterization communities and
  stakeholders.
