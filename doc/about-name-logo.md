# About the name and logo
The name _Elementary Multiperspective Material Ontology_ should be understood as follows:

- **Elementary** means, amongst others, that EMMO is a discrete ontology assuming the existence of a smallest possible 4D world object in space and time.  The term _Elementary_ in EMMO refers to objects that cannot be divided further in space.  Elementary also emphasizes EMMO being a fundamental, top-level ontology.
- **Multiperspective** highlights a very important aspect of EMMO - that it is possible to describe the world from different perspectives.  This makes the ontology both flexible and expressive.
- **Material** (as the opposite of immaterial) emphasises that EMMO is strictly nominalistic, meaning that it assumes that abstracts do not exist.  _Material_ also refers to the historical scope of EMMO aiming at the description of materials and thus to cover the needs of physicists and applied scientists.
- **Ontology**, yes EMMO is an ontology.  It is based on fundamental philosophical concepts like semiosis, mereology and topology.

A lot can be said about the logo:
* The circles refer to Peirce's semiotics with the triadic relation between sign, object and interpretant with the interpreter in the middle.
* The symmetry indicates that EMMO supports multiple perspectives.
* The E-like signs can be seen from different perspectives (angles), making it possible to read it as **E** **M** **M** **ⵔ** as well as **∃** (there exists) a **Ш**hole **Ш**orld **ⵔ**ntology (with the circle in the middle).
* The 3+1 circles emphasises that EMMO is a 4D ontology with three spatial plus one time dimension.
* The lines connecting the circles may refer to graph theory and knowledge graphs.
* A triangle is a common way to represent a ternary phase diagram showing the close connection to physics.
